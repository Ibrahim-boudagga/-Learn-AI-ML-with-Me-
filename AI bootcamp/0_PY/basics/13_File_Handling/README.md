## How to Use These Files

### Running Individual Files
Each file can be run independently to learn specific concepts:

```bash
# Run basic file operations
python 01_basic_file_operations.py

# Run file modes and methods
python 02_file_modes_and_methods.py

# Run file information and directory operations
python 03_file_information_and_directory_operations.py

# Run CSV files examples
python 04_csv_files.py

# Run JSON files examples
python 05_json_files.py

# Run binary files examples
python 06_binary_files.py

# Run error handling and large files
python 07_error_handling_and_large_files.py

python 09_practice_problems_1.py
python 10_practice_problems_2.py
```

### Running All Files Sequentially
To run all files in order:

```bash
# Run all files in sequence
for file in *.py; do
    echo "Running $file..."
    python "$file"
    echo "----------------------------------------"
done
```

8. **File Comparison**: Compare files and identify differences
9. **File Filtering**: Filter file content based on criteria
10. **File Deduplication**: Remove duplicate content from files

## Tips for Learning

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with simple file operations before moving to advanced concepts
2. **Experiment**: Create test files and try different operations
3. **Handle Errors**: Always implement proper error handling in file operations
4. **Consider Performance**: Use appropriate techniques for large files
5. **Practice Regularly**: Use the practice problems to reinforce your learning
6. **Understand Formats**: Learn the characteristics of different file formats
7. **Test Edge Cases**: Handle missing files, permissions, and encoding issues

## Common Patterns

- **Context Managers**: Use `with` statements for safe file operations
