# Python Basics Course

This folder contains fundamental Python programming concepts organized in a modular, structured learning path. Each topic is split into focused, small files for easier learning and practice.

## Course Structure

### 1. Getting Started
- **01_Introduction/** - Python installation, first program, basic syntax
- **02_Variables_DataTypes/** - Variables, data types, type conversion

### 2. Core Data Types
- **03_Numbers/** - Integers, floats, mathematical operations
- **04_Strings/** - String manipulation, methods, formatting
- **05_Lists/** - List creation, manipulation, methods
- **06_Tuples/** - Tuple basics, immutability, operations
- **07_Dictionaries/** - Key-value pairs, dictionary operations
- **08_Sets/** - Set operations, unique elements

### 3. Control Flow
- **09_Conditionals/** - If, elif, else statements
- **10_Loops/** - For and while loops, loop control

### 4. Functions & Modules
- **11_Functions/** - Function definition, parameters, return values
- **12_Modules_Packages/** - Importing, creating modules and packages

### 5. File Handling
- **13_File_Handling/** - Reading, writing, and manipulating files

## How to Use

Each topic folder contains:
- `README.md` - Theory, explanations, and a table of contents for the topic
- Numbered `.py` files - Each covers a single concept or subtopic (e.g., `01_list_creation.py`, `02_list_operations.py`)
- Practice problems at the end of each topic (e.g., `09_practice_problems.py`)

**To learn effectively:**
1. Start with the first file in each folder and work through them in order
2. Run any file with:
   ```bash
   python 01_example.py
   ```
3. Read the comments and outputs to understand each concept
4. Try modifying the code and solving the practice problems

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Learning Path

1. Start with **01_Introduction** to set up your environment
2. Progress through data types in order (Numbers → Strings → Lists → Tuples → Dictionaries → Sets)
3. Learn control flow with conditionals and loops
4. Master functions and modules
5. Practice with file handling
6. Complete the practice problems at the end of each topic
